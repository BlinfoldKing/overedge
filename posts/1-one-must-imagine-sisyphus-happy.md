# One Must Imagine Sisyphus Happy

> "To live is to suffer, to survive is to find some meaning in the suffering." - Friedrich Nietzsche

Hey you,  
how's life? Did you manage to achieve something in your life? or did life betray all of your hard work?
Have you ever felt that all of your hard work is useless, or maybe you are the type of person where luck
carry you life without much effort? and if our struggle in life have the posiblity to become nothing but futile effort, is there any inherent meaning to continue our life. Fortunately my friend, Sisyphus, could be feeling the same as you.

## The Meaningless King
So, who is Sisyphus? Why is he special? You could say Sisyphus is your typical mythical greek king (Being rich, deceitful, a little bit pevert). One day, He happened to witness an eagle kidnap a maiden. Later, he met the river god, Asopus, who were happened to chase the eagle telling Sisyphus that his daughter were kidnapped by Zeus in eagle form. Sisyphus being a your typical greek king try to exploit the situation. He agreed to tell Asopus the direction of Zeus flight if Asopus could summon a spring in his kingdom. Asopus then agreed, and thus a new spring flow in the city, and Sisyphus show Asopus the direction of Zeus whereabout.  

Zeus later, being engraged, capture sisyphus and sent him to hades (greek version of hell). As Sisyphus were about to be chained by Thanathos (the incarnation of death). Sisyphus did a pro gamer move, and ask thanathos how does the chain works. Somehow, Thanathos tell him how it works. And, Sisyphus being our typical trickster king escaped from the chain and chain Thanathos instead with the knowledge on how the chain works. As Sisyphus escape hades, apparently people stopped dying as Thanatos were currently out of work. Ares, the war god, now being bored as war become less fun with no one dying, rode to hades, free Thanathos, learnt what happened and proceed to track Sisyphus down.

Being captured twice, the gods decide that Sisyphus should be brought to Persephone, Queen of the Underworld. As usual, Sisyphus pulled another pro game move, as he meet the Queen, he lamented on how disrespect his wife is. Sisyphus tell the queen that his wife didn't even gave him a proper burial.
He begged for the queen to let him life temporarily to punish his wife and get a proper burial before serving his punishment in the underworld. Persephone agreed, and thus Sisyphus were back to the realm of the living.  

Later, it was apparent that Sisyphus didn't meant to pubish his wife, or got a proper burial either. Thus making the agreement useless. Zeus getting more annoyed by Sisyphus, captured him for the final time. Knowing what Sisyphus were capable of, Zeus design a punishment befitting for Prideful man as Sisyphus. From that day onward Sisyphus were to live to push a boulder unto the tip of a mountain, but if Sisyphus manage to do that, the boulder would start tumbling down into the foot of the mountain, repeating the cycle. Thus once prideful king reduced into a unending boulder pusher.

## Is life Meaningless?

Now, that you know Sisyphus story, what do you think his feeling right now? feeling regret? angry? or instead being happy? And does it have to with our life.  

Sisyphus life perfectly represent our modern life, being told to do our "responsibilty" wether it was job, family, school, or pushing a boulder with sometimes no reason other that it was what others told you to do or being unjusted by society or felt cheated with those luckier than us. And sometimes even if we managed to *push our boulder to the peak*, it will rolled back again and our struggle begin anew. If our struggle is meaningless, and no matter how many problem we solved, another one would show up, should we be happy?

Now imagine the same question being asked to Sisyphus, would he be happy? No one could possibly know the answer. But if we have to guess. **We have to guess Sisyphus happy**.

Just as he tricks and deceive gods in his lifetime, wouldn't it be fitting that a prideful human that also hates death so much, would be happy in his meaningless existence, as being happy could be a form of protest to his meaningless existence. By him being happy with his punishment then it was no punishment at all. Thus even though his existence have no meaning, he giving it meaning by just being happy.

So, Is life meaningless? Probably yes, but probably not. But even if the world is meaningless and absurd, should it bother us? Absolutely not, just as Sisyphus giving meaning to his boulder-pushing existence with just being happy, one must strive to give his/her life greatest burdens a meaning and being happy in the meantime.

> "I leave Sisyphus at the foot of the mountain. One always finds one's burden again. But Sisyphus teaches the higher fidelity that negates the gods and raises rocks. He too concludes that all is well. This universe henceforth without a master seems to him neither sterile nor futile. Each atom of that stone, each mineral flake of that night-filled mountain, in itself, forms a world. The struggle itself toward the heights is enough to fill a man's heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy." - Albert Camus
