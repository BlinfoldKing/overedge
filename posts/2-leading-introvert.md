# A Leading Introvert?
> Introvert,  
"Noun, â€‹a quiet person who is more interested in their own thoughts and feelings than in spending time with other people." - Oxford Dictionary  

When someone speak about leadership, more often than not, the word "introvert" is not the first word you would associate with being a leader. But rather, the word is often associated with being awkward, anti-social, and a loner. But in reality, some of the best leaders, especially in modern time, is either an introvert or shared some common habits and quality that usually being associated with an introvert.

Speaking of introverts, what are they exactly? if you are like me as a kid, adults around you probably defined you as an introvert if you are shy, quite, or being a nerd. Although there's some grain of truth to that kind of definition, it's not quite on mark. So what is it then? First, Imagine if every human have an social energy meter, and if you run out of the energy you get tired, sad, or even depressed. If you are an extrovert, your energy will be depleted everytime you don't have any social interaction, and crave for social interaction to "charge" their energy. On contrary, an introvert will feel more exhausted for every social interaction especially if the said interaction involves multiple participants, thus most of introvert avoid unnecessary social interactions. These ideas of introvert avoid interaction whereas extrovert crave for it enforcing the streotypes of introverts being socially awkward, and extroverts being the masters of any social situation.

Now, that we are in the same page on the definition of introversion, how can someone being an effective leader while being an introvert. Especially when you consider being a leader involves a lot of social interaction, or is it? Fortunately, my dear fellow introvert readers, i happens to have some experience with the topics, as i previously led some team both in my job, school, and even being ~~forced to be~~ a president on some organization with hundreds of members. For the rest of this post i would like to share some of my trial and tribulations as i try to understand the art of leading.

## When You Speak, Looks Them in The Eye

![](/static/yes.png)

One of the common image of a leader, usually involves the leader being in communication with multiple person at the same time in order to lead them. While that image is not necessarily true nor effective, it is true that an effective leader have to be able to communicate their instruction and direction clearly and effectively. But, just as nature of introversion stated in previous section, we tends to avoid social interaction with others. Well, for example most of use had been taught that when you conversing with others, we need to maintain eye contact with the opposite party. Some said this mannerism is needed to show our politeness and a signal that we have full attention to the opposite party. As introvert, it just doesn't feel right and even exhausting to maintain eye contact and maintain conversation at the same time. But did you know you can create the same effect just by looking the eyebrow of you partner when conversing, this trick will create and illusion of you paying full attention to the opposite party in the conversation. Speaking of maintaining eye contact, although it is true that it shows you are paying attention, but prolonged eye contact could felt like intimidation to some, so use it with care. On the other hand, if you are still dreading on looking someone on the eye, there are few tricks that could have the same effect. For example, when the opposite party describing their story you could try to whisper some confirming word such as "oh really?", "i see", or just as simple hum of "hm...hmmm", Or you could instead repeat a few sentence of their story when you reply. The Idea is to figure what kind of gesture and tricks you should deploy on conversation, and remember that you main goal in communication are to instruct, describe, or inquire, the method in which you gain those goals is trivial as long it works for you and your opposite party. Just there are many roads to Rome, there are many ways to converse with other, but one must decide which roads to suit oneself.

Now that we know some tricks to maintain a conversation, we could discuss how should we instruct others. First, compare your position to those you are giving instruction to. If you are in lower position (let's say you are younger, of less technically able) compared to them, it is wise to give the instruction as politely as possible, and asking their opinion as much as possible, eventhough you will not implement their opinion, it is important to ask either way so that will avoid problem if they happens to be a prideful person. Whereas if you are in somewhat higher position (maybe you are older, or rather have more technically able), Try to elaborate your instruction as clearly as possible and try to confirm if they are understand the instruction, for those with less experience sometimes feels shy, and afraid making fool out of themselves thus hinders them to ask when there are some unclear instructions. The other things that we have to consider when giving instruction is how much persons do we brief at the same times. The more persons involves in the conversation when giving instruction the less focus will the conversation be, even it'll take longer times to do. The best thing you could do is to split the briefing process into smaller session with smaller participants as possible, do it one on one person conversation if you need so. But remember, that most projects require teamwork, so avoid one on one as you could, to enforce transparency on your team.

After you instruct the team, your works has just begun, you have to make sure that those instrctions have to be executed as instructed or even better. When tracking your team progress it is important to be subtle and as unintrusive as possible, you main goals as a leader is to ensure that the project is done. Thus you have to avoid unnecessary meeting. A meeting is a good way to check on progress of every member, but on a meeting each participant cannot continue to work as long as the meeting being held. What you can do then is either making the report process individually per member or with some (task) related members, or if the team is consisted of small amount of member you could held a quick meeting to track progress.

## Define, Divide, and Delegate

Being able to communicate, especially giving out instruction is sure to be an essential skill to have in leading others. But, it'll be rendered useless if you don't know what to intruct, how do we measure that it is done, and to whom should we allocate the task.

Let's assume that you already know what your goal is. How do you know that goal is achieved? what are the conditions to declare when the goal is achieved. The common mistake on pursuing a goal is the inability to define the "definition of done". Without a clear definition you will end up in what i call "revision hell" where you try to revise the job, without ever satisfied any condition. By defining a clear definition of done, you are limiting your effort to the defined conditions, thus avoid unncessary works and revisions. And if after the conditions being fulfilled and yet you are not yet satisfied with the conditions, then you define a new definition to refine the works that has been done, and if for some reason you are not able to deliver the new definition of done in time, you don't need to worry because essentially you already complete the job.

> "Make it work, make it fast, make it right." - Kent Beck

After considering the definition of done, you have to consider how can you compare that condition in which the the job being considered done compared to how the starting condition happens to be. By creating a definition of done that corellate or at least can be compare to the starting condition, you could evalutate which condition that accidentally have been (fully or partially) fullfilled by the current condition. If your definitions of done require a lot of conditions, then what you could do is to separate those conditions into smaller condition, which we could define as **a task**, a task have may also have its own definiton of done and could be break down into smaller subtask if needed. By dividing a job into smaller process will help you determining which task/condition to prioritize, to execute, to delegate, or even to drop it.

In the topic of priotization and delegation, how does one prioritize and delegate a task. Imagine if you have a table such as this table being illustrated below:
![](/static/eisenhower-matrix.png)
This table is known as **Eisenhower Matrix**. What we can do is assign our job and task into one of four room of the matrix by its importance and urgency. We could define importance of a task which how much impact it'll have into the progress of the overall project, whilst urgency define how much (negative) impact it'll have on the constraint of the project (usually involing budget, and time limit, etc.). After you label every task based on its importance and urgency you could conclude that:
1. If it is both important and Urgency, you have to finish it ASAP, you can either do it yourselves or let top performance of the team to finish it. For example if your team is tasked to build a house, we could absolutely agree that the foundation is the most important part to be built, and if not being done as fast as possible we won't be able to progress to other part of the house, thus building a foundation is both important and urgent.
2. If it is Important but not an urgent condition. You could schedule it to be worked down the timeline later. following the previous example, toilet were an essential part of the house, i bet your client would be furious if they found out that their house doesn't have a toilet, but at the same time, we know that building the toilet now or later at the end of the project won't effect much (if any) progress of the overall house, thus it is important to do, but we could do it later.
3. If it is not important have to be done immediately (urgent), then you could delegate it to someone in the team, or even delegate it to a third party. Back to our house-building example, let's say when you as your team building the foundation, and plan to build the toilet later, we could agree that procuring the materials needed for the toilet now is unnecessary, but if we delaying on procuring it, by the time we have to build the toilet, there's a chance that the materials would't be delivered to you on time. Thus to procre the materials as soon as possible is urgent, thus we have to delegate the task so it can be delivered as soon as possible.
4. If it is not important, and not in an urgent condition, just drop the task and forget it. the explaination is simple why would you do something that doesn't contribute both to the progress of the project or ease the constraint being put to the project. For example did you need to build a whole new construction machine from scratch if you can just rent it for the duration of the house project? Some problem have many different correct solutions thus be aware of which solution to follow through and which one to be dropped.

## Avoid Unnecessary Voting

For the final advice, more often than not, as a team we would be facing a difference of opinions or approach to the task at hand. Most of us would be tempted to hold a voting session. Eventhough it could works, but for most of the problem we face working as a team have to be solve with conclusive solutions. For example if for some reason your team consisted of majority engineers, would you hold a voting session to solve a financial problem? it could probably works, but there is a slim chance that the engineers doesn't understand the problem at all. Your best move is to consult to the expert of problem in your team to find the most conclusive solution and the reasoning behind it. Only resort to vote when either there is no conclusive solution to draw, or that there are multiple solution with fairly similar risk and reward.

## Author's Note

Now that you reach the end of this lengthy advice. Now that most of this advice were made up from my experience or that i forgot from whom/when/how did i learn any of this, so take any of these advice with a healthy dose of skepticism. This post were written to encourage my fellow introvert that you too, could lead a team, because as my experience told me sometimes being an introvert, people would misundertand us to be anti-social and incapable of leading others. And for you who doesn't have any interest of being a leader, I firmly believe that that try to learn to lead is invaluable experience, as you would be communicating and gathering knowledge from people with various background whether they are inside or outside of your team. And for those introvert who do have the interest, i wish you luck and shall we meet on top...from each other house...through the internet...or you know what, screw that, i just wanna read some book instead.
