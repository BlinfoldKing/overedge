# About Me

Hello,  
I don't know how you manage to find this tiny trace of my virtual existence, but however it is and whoever are you i bid you welcome.

Professionally, i am a poet with speciality of composing line of verses that make electrical machine bend to my will, mastering both the fine art of back end engineering and excruciating pain of ~~javascript~~ front end development. Ventured from the smallest unto largest kind of tech court.

And...

To be honest, aside from my professional background there's no interesting thing to know about me :<. Regardless, enjoy your stay here and hope you find anything that you seek.
